# README
organization-wide defaults for `.github` files, like `pull_request_template.md`, `ISSUE_TEMPLATE`, etc.
The content of a specific repos' `.github` folder will override what's here.

This repo built with guidance from https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-default-community-health-file,
and in response to a need, from Vanta, that pull request templates exist for all repositories
